**Generated**: 2026-01-20 21:57:59

**Summary**: 2 warning(s) found during final implementation verification.

## Warnings

### Task 16: delegation.service_delegation.actions

- **Type**: Argument
- **Required**: No
- **Issue**: Implementation not found or commented out (verified by Copilot)

### Task 20: timeouts

- **Type**: Block
- **Required**: No
- **Issue**: Implementation not found or commented out (verified by Copilot)

## Recommendations

Please review the tasks listed above to verify they haven't been completely deleted:
1. Check if the implementation still exists in any form in the Terraform files
2. Verify that variables, outputs, or resources related to these tasks are present
3. If required tasks are missing, they must be re-implemented
4. If optional tasks are missing, evaluate if they should be restored

**Note**: Implementation details may have changed during acceptance testing - that's normal.
This check only alerts you to tasks that appear to be completely missing from the final code.

If a warning is a false positive (implementation exists but wasn't detected), 
you can proceed safely. Manual verification of critical required tasks is recommended.
